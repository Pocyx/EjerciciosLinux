EXERCISES OF CHAPTER 4

1. Complete the following table:

654	rw-r-xr--
766	rwxrw-rw
777	rwxrwxrwx
520	-r---x---
764	rwxrw-r--
440	r--r-----

In the following exercises, you should use the required Linux commands to perform the
operations described.

2. Create the groups office1 and office2.

# groupadd office1
# groupadd office2

3. Create the users gearoid and paul. These users must belong only to the group
office1.

# adduser gearoid --ingroup office1
# adduser paul --ingroup office1

4. Create the users anna and emma. These users must belong only to the group office2.

# adduser anna --ingroup office2
# adduser emma --ingroup office2

5. As user gearoid, create a file named topsecret.txt in his home directory. Only
this user must have access to this file, both for reading and writing.

$ su gearoid
$ cd
$ touch top_secret.txt
$ chmod 600 top_secret.txt

6. Create another file named sales.txt, also as user gearoid,. All users in the same
group as gearoid must have access to this file, both for reading and writing. The
permissions for owner and the rest of users must remain as default. Check that you can
modify the file if you access it as user paul.

$ touch sales.txt
$ chmod g+rw sales.txt
We can check that user paul can modify this file because he is a member of the same
group:
$ exit
$ su paul
$ vi /home/gearoid/sales.txt

7. As user anna, create a file named employees.txt. Any user must have access to
read its content and any user in the same group must have access to read or write to it.

$ exit
$ su anna
$ cd
$ touch employees.txt
$ chmod 664 employees.txt

8. Create the user student (if it is not yet created). Copy the file employees.txt to
the home directory of user student . Change the owner and the group of this file to
student.

$ exit
$ sudo cp /home/anna/employees.txt /home/student/
$ sudo chown student /home/student/employees.txt
$ sudo chgrp student /home/student/employees.txt

17. Supose a user has read access to a file, but this file is in a directory for which the user has
no read access. Could this user read this file? Try it.

El usuario no puede ver el contenido de un fichero sin permiso de lectura.Para poderlo ver el archivo 
tendría que tener l permiso 777.
